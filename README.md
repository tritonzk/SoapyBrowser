Godot app to browser GTR records and create playlists for the game Zeepkist.

Currently the app is a work in progress. I plan to release an v0.1alpha which has these functions:

- Browse a list of gtr users sorted by amount of points
- show records by users filtered by Personal best, World records, Author time records. Sorted by recency
- show personal stats and records

For v0.2 I add the playlist functionality from my other mod ZeeplistCurator.

For 0.3 I want to add a track browsing UI

for 0.4 I want to integrate the track browing UI with some more functionality such as tagging, notes, adding to playlists, integration with the records view, etc.

Version 0.5 will be mostly function complete. The following versions will be to clean up the UI and code. I am still learning Godot so I expect there to be many bugs and kinks I want to Iron out in the end.
